# 💫 About Me:
Hi, I'm Gift🙋🏿‍♂️<br><br>I'm a software developer passionate about building practical solutions that tackle real-world problems (starting with my own, of course! 😂). My primary interests lie in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Automations and I'm actively building my expertise to become a Machine Learning Engineer.<br><br>Python is my go-to language for its versatility and alignment with my work. I'm also deeply fascinated by cloud computing and how it empowers scalable applications.<br><br>I recently collaborated on a Plant Disease Prediction project, where my colleagues and I developed an AI system to help farmers detect plant diseases through image recognition, primarily using Python. This experience significantly deepened my understanding of artificial intelligence in practice.<br><br>I'm eager to embark on more projects to hone my skills in AI and Machine Learning. If you have an idea or project in this field, I'd love to connect so we can build the future through code!<br><br>Feel free to explore my repositories to see what I'm currently working on!
